    <p>After the first time I drove an excavator, I wanted to become an excavator operator. It takes a lot of hard work and a high level of skill to be regarded as an operator in the civil construction industry. The journey was a lot harder than I initially thought it would be but I put in the work and have been employed as an operator for the last 7 years. I still enjoy operating excavators, but I canâ€™t see myself working in the construction industry for the rest of my life. I thought a lot about what I wanted out of my life and career and considered many options. One that kept on coming back to me was coding. I researched what is involved in coding, career paths and what the culture of the tech industry is like and was drawn towards it. I first tried my hand at coding on Free Code Camp and found that I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it and I was surprised at how rewarding it felt to write code. That was when I decided to sign up to Dev Academy for their full-stack bootcamp and I haven't looked back. I love the challenge of learning new concepts and how rewarding it is when I fully understand them. The more code I write, the more I enjoy it and want to pursue a career in software development.</p>
