    <h3>To-Do-To-Day</h3>
    <p class="script-txt">This is the final group project that I was involved in for Dev Academy. We wanted to build a task management app that was fun and easy to use. Having learned React in Dev Academy we used that along with SQL and typescript. I wanted to gain some moore exposure to Auth0 so I took the lead on implementing that which was a challenge because it then meant we had to apply some extra syntax to the rest of the code we wrote but I'm glad I did because I learned a lot in doing so.</p>

    <h3>Surf-log</h3>
       <p class="script-txt">This is the my personal project that I started while I was at Dev Academy that combines my two passions of coding and surfing. I wanted an app where you can log information of your surf session against forecasted conditions so that you can make more informed decisions about where to surf according to the forecast. I have used Typescript, Javascript and React with SQL for the database. My learning objective was to focus on forms and I quickly learned how tricky they can be. Currently a work in progress.</p>
